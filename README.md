intellij-cucumber-scala 0.3.0
=======================

Enables Reference tracking of glue code when using cucumber-scala DSL.

#Features

- [x] Navigate from feature step to step definition
- [ ] Find usages of step definitions in feature files
- [ ] Wizard that creates step definitions for a step in a feature file


#Development

1. `git clone git@github.com:danielwegener/intellij-cucumber-scala.git`
2. `sbt downloadIdea` will download the idea sdk to the SDK folder
3. `sbt downloadPlugins` will download the dependent plugins from jetbrains repo to the SDK folder
4. Import the project as maven project into IDEA. Make sure to use your prepared IDEA version as plugin sdk.

To debug set

`export IDE_JVM_ARGS="-Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=4000,suspend=n"`

Now you can build this plugin with `mvn -Didea.home=PATH_TO_IDEA clean install` or use a IDEA plugin run configuration to debug it.

> IntelliJ Plugin Development is too hard :/ Please provide a public (maybe non-oss, non-free) repo for Idea artifacts. Or maybe a sbt plugin.
